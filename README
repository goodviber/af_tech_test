What we are looking for: functionality, efficiency, readability and tests.

Use this test to demonstrate your understanding of OO and TDD.

Write a ruby script that:

a. Receives a log as argument (webserver.log is provided)

e.g.: ./parser.rb webserver.log

b. Returns the following:

> list of webpages with most page views ordered from most pages views to less page views

     e.g.:

         /home 90 visits

         /index 80 visits

         etc...

> list of webpages with most unique page views also ordered

     e.g.:

         /about/2   8 unique views

         /index     5 unique views

         etc...

built in ruby version 2.6.3

run script in terminal with: `ruby lib/parser_oo.rb data/webserver.log` as per description spec. Could also be run as a rake task to clean up test output.

run tests with: `rake`
